  introductionText:
  - Stable port to Qurotema, all nominal. RO, your vision should come in soon.
  - Reminder, because of the Gates, this is a one-way only communication channel.
  - We'll keep watch and study Qurotema alongside you, Operator.
  - Your vessel is equipped with a control module.\nFeels weird at first, I know.
    Experiment, you'll get used to it.
  - And Di... Make Sino proud.
  monolithText:
  - We've got a feed of the characters. So this is the "i-tema" Sino spoke about.\nSaid
    there's no way to speak it, it's a writing-only language.
  - 'Actually, this looks like our set of translated text.\nIt say: ''The night will
    flow when black time''s sand knows foreign touch.'
  - The writing on the gates shares two of those words, "Quro" and "Tema". Those
    are our only translations.\nThe origin of our station's name.
  - I'm not sure how Sino felt so confident understanding i-tema, it looks incomprehensible
    to me.\nFind more Monoliths, it'll help us fill a database for linguistic analysis.
  instrumentText:
  - We hav. signals of faint acit.vity aw.y from your vessel's current pos.tion.
  - We've l.st sight .f your fe.d, but we are st..l getting al. oth.r r.adings. Ke.p
    up the research.
  - Our co..ection is bec.ming unreli.ble. Begin..ng pu.l, s.ay c.lm.

  uniqueText:
  - Right there, in front of you is one of the Monoliths Dr. Sino spoke about. There
    should be a sort of writing 'eminating' from it.\nDo you see anything? Maybe
    it needs to be activated.
  - What is that? Nothing like that was documented in Sino's notes.
